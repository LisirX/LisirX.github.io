In "Danger Zone: the Coming Conflict with China", Hal Brands of Johns Hopkins University and Michael Beckley of Tufts University argue that the world’s giants are `engaged` in a decade-long `sprint`, not a "hundred-year marathon", as the title of another book puts it. China is about to have "a hard fall" or may already be in `decline`, they argue. This makes it more dangerous, not less. It could soon try to `seize` Taiwan, while it is still able to do so.**

## Para.3

**The authors thus `flip` the "Thucydides trap" `popularised= by another professor, Graham Allison, who argued that China and America were destined for war in the same way as `a rising Athens and a fearful Sparta came to blows in antiquity`. `Messrs Brands and Beckley argue instead that the Athens of Thucydides was not an upstart, but a risen power fighting to avert decline.` `Imperial Japan’s fear of economic strangulation, leading to its surprise attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, is an example of such a "peaking power trap".`**

1. flip v. （使）快速翻转，迅速翻动 -> 推翻
2. popularised adj. 使……受欢迎 -> 被……提出的
3. a rising Athens and a fearful Sparta came to blows in antiquity 在古代，崛起的雅典和威风凛然的斯巴达发生了冲突
- blow(s) n. ≈ conflict(s)
- 

- 参考[《雅典与斯巴达是什么关系？雅典与斯巴达战争介绍！》浮泊凉](https://www.86lsw.com/sjls/2934.html)
- 雅典和斯巴达都是希腊的城邦，两城人民说着共同的语言。但在其他方面，两城截然不同。雅典海拔颇高，常年受海风滋润，雅典人总是像快乐的孩童一般观察着这个世界；而斯巴达则修建在一座深谷里，四周环绕的高山把外界的思想也挡在了外面。
- 雅典是一座经济繁荣的城市；而斯巴达则像一座兵营，人们的梦想就是成为一名士兵。雅典喜欢沐浴在阳光下，讨论诗歌或者倾听哲人的箴言；而斯巴达人从未创作出可以称之为文学的只言片语，但是他们知道如何战斗。他们酷爱战斗，为了做好战斗准备，他们甚至不惜抛弃人类所有的情感。
- 因此，当雅典获得成功时，斯巴达人对他们恨之入骨也就不足为奇了。雅典人将战时激发出的强大精力用在建设城市上。雅典卫城得以重建，并被作为大理石神殿以祭司雅典女神。伯里克利——雅典民主制度的领袖，寻遍各处，找到著名的雕塑家、画家和科学家，让他们参与雅典的重建，为的是让雅典变得更加美丽，让年轻人为家乡感到自豪。
- 与此同时，伯里克利还时刻关注着斯巴达，他修建了连接雅典和大海的高大城墙，使雅典成为当时防御最坚固的城邦。一次小小的争执终于让这两个希腊城邦兵戎相见。雅典和斯巴达的战争一共持续了30年。最终，雅典惨败。
- 战争进行到第三年，一场瘟疫袭击了雅典。半数之多的雅典人都死于这场瘟疫，包括伟大的领袖伯里克利。瘟疫过后，雅典一度陷入无人管理的局面。这时，一位名叫阿尔西比阿德的年轻人受到了人们的器重。他建议对位于西西里岛的斯巴达殖民地锡拉库扎进行一次远征。
- 于是，雅典人组建好军队，做好了一切准备。但阿尔西比阿德却因卷入一场斗殴而被迫逃亡。接任他的将军是个庸人，他不仅赔掉了舰队，还把陆军也葬送了。少数幸存下来的雅典士兵被带到锡拉库扎的采石场上做苦力，最终被活活饿死、渴死。
- 这次远征几乎让雅典所有的年轻人都丢掉了性命，雅典城的灭亡已注定。公元前404年4月，雅典终于抵挡不住长期的包围，投降了。高大的城墙被夷为平地，海军也被斯巴达人接管。作为庞大殖民帝国的中心，雅典曾经强极一时，但如今，一切已不复存在。
- 但是，她对知识、真理的渴望和探究，在繁荣昌盛的时代里让她的人民卓尔不群，这些并不会随着城墙的倒塌和海军的转接而消失。这种精神与世长存，并将进一步发扬光大。雅典再也不能掌握希腊半岛的命运了。但如今，作为学术的发源地，雅典的影响已超越希腊狭小的国境，影响着那些充满智慧的人。

4. Messrs Brands and Beckley argue instead that the Athens of Thucydides was not an upstart, but a risen power fighting to avert decline. 布兰兹和贝克利则认为，修昔底德时代的雅典并不是一个新贵，而是一个为避免衰落而斗争的崛起的大国。
- avert v. 防止，避免（危险、坏事） ≈ avoid

  - A disaster was narrowly averted. 及时防止了一场灾难。

  - He did his best to avert suspicion. 他尽量避嫌。

- upstart n. 自命不凡的新上任者；狂妄自大的新手

- 

- 参考[《希腊城邦政治——"修昔底德陷阱"》知行路上道历史](https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1733540667572620198&wfr=spider&for=pc)

- 他在《伯罗奔尼撒战争史》这部著作中提出了当时伯罗奔尼撒战争的真正原因，书中写道："战争的真正原因，是势力壮大的雅典人，引起了斯巴达人的恐惧，从而迫使他们开战。"

- 所以他认为雅典和斯巴达的战争是不可避免的。

- 修昔底德提出的"新兴大国威胁论"导致战争无法避免的观点，被当今的某些政客视为处理当代国际关系的"铁律"，后世人们将他的观点称为"修昔底德陷阱"。

- 而当今某些政客将这一理论作为攻击别国的理论依据，即认为一个新崛起的大国必然挑战现存的大国，而现存大国也必然回应这种威胁。
5. Imperial Japan’s fear of economic strangulation, leading to its surprise attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941, is an example of such a "peaking power trap".
- 日本帝国因为对经济危机产生恐惧，所以在1941年偷袭珍珠港这件事，就是这种"权力顶峰陷阱"（修昔底德陷阱）的一个例子。

## Para.4

**Both elements of the `thesis`—that China is `peaking` and that war is `imminent`—are `contested` by other `analysts`. `Yet it captures something of the zeitgeist in Washington.` Experts debate whether China’s slowdown means it has hit the "middle-income trap" (in which poor countries struggle to grow more than moderately rich). They also fret about growing hostility between America and China, and military tension around Taiwan (see next article).**

1. thesis n. 论文，毕业（或学位）论文；论题，论点；（文章的）主题

6. Yet it captures something of the zeitgeist in Washington. 然而，它抓住了华盛顿的一些时代精神。
- 关于这个`zeitgeist`(时代思潮)的解释就在下文：the debate among "middle-income trap ", "`hostility`(敌意，对抗) between America and China" and "military tension around Taiwan"
- middle-income trap 中等收入陷阱是指发展中国家工业化进程中奉行GDP增长方式，经过一段时间的经济高速增长使人均收入达到中等收入水平时，由于道德沦丧、法治崩溃、腐败与两极分化严重，迅速形成既得利益集团并使既得利益集团迅速垄断国家资源、掌控国家经济命脉、掌握国家大部分财富，造成国内市场萎缩、产业升级乏力、增长停滞不前、民族主体性削弱、经济对外依赖性增强的状态。参考：[中等收入陷阱](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%B8%AD%E7%AD%89%E6%94%B6%E5%85%A5%E9%99%B7%E9%98%B1/3263713?fr=aladdin)
- 其余两个，显而易见。

## Para.5

**The analysis of China’s intentions matters because it affects American policy. "Is China just a drunk in a bar, or is it `Tony Soprano giving you the evil eye while he sips his whiskey`?" asks Jude Blanchette of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a `think-tank`. "If we think China is a near-term threat, then we throw everything at `deterring` it militarily and we forget about competing over the global order."**

1. Tony Soprano giving you the evil eye while he sips his whiskey
- sip v. 小口喝，抿

## Para.6

**Many experts have come a `cropper` predicting China’s collapse. Still, Messrs Brands and Beckley argue that its `stellar` growth resulted from several factors that are now `reversing`. A `demographic` boom is turning to `bust`. Market `reforms` are `yielding` to a `re-centralisation of the economy`, the `cowing` of `innovative` tech firms and a struggle to control debt. A "smarter `autocracy`" with slightly looser political controls has `reverted` to the more oppressive form, creating a `techno-surveillance` state. And instead of `embracing` China’s rise, rich countries have started to `constrain` trade. Some economists, such as Thomas Orlik, argue that China’s rulers have enough resources, `regulatory` `levers` and experience to avert a `systemic` crisis. A new edition of his book on China’s economy, "The Bubble That Never Pops", is about to be published.**

18. systemic adj. 涉及全系统的；系统的；影响全身的；全身的

- 见[《什么是系统性种族歧视》老杨](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/268227119)
- "而Systemic的意思是of or relating to a system，即与系统有关，换句话说是，这是描述一种现象，比如疾病或社会问题，如果你说那是systemic的，意思就是那种现象不是个别现象，而是整体性的、结构性的、内在的，这个词的近义词。"

## Para.7

**In a `commentary` for Foreign Affairs, a journal, Oriana Skylar Mastro of Stanford University and Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, argue that the hard fall is unlikely. China’s relative decline, if it happens, is likely to be  gradual. Its military power will keep growing. It will want to seize Taiwan, but need not lash out. Rising or peaking, China is liable to be more aggressive, they think. But America should avoid "short-term solutions that `undermine` its ability to compete in the long term".**

1. commentary n. 注释；解释；评注；评论
2. undermine v. 逐渐削弱（信心、权威等）；使逐步减少效力

## Para.8

**President Joe Biden regards China as the greatest threat to America’s `primacy`, but for now seems to treat it `principally` as an economic and political challenge. His defence-budget request for the coming `fiscal` year implies the military threat will be most `acute` only in the 2030s. It seeks a below-`inflation` increase, and `invests` heavily in research and development for future weapons. The size of America’s `fleet`, already smaller than China’s, is set to `shrink` before it expands again in the next decade. Meanwhile, the `aukus` agreement to provide Australia with nuclear-powered `submarines` will probably not deliver the first boat before 2040.**  

1. primacy n. 首要；至高无上
2. principally adj. ≈ mainly, chiefly 主要地

10. submarine n. 潜水艇

## Para.9

**`Prominent` military figures, though, are alarmed. Admiral Philip Davidson, the former head of America’s Indo-Pacific Command, argues: "The threat is `manifest` in this decade, and certainly in the next four or five years. From the bottom of the sea to space, we’re seeing the Chinese becoming better." His `successor`, Admiral John Aquilino, says China wants to finish modernising its `armed forces` by 2027. The timeline is shrinking, he told the Senate in March.**

1. prominent adj. 重要的；著名的；杰出的
2. manifest adj. 明显的；显而易见的
3. successor n. 后继者
4. armed force （一国的）武装部队，武装力量

## Para.10

The Indo-Pacific Command’s list of unfunded `priorities` runs to $1.5bn. The largest sums would `boost` its ability to protect (or attack) satellites; buy more `long-range anti-ship missiles`; and enable "`campaigning`", which involves networks to share information with allies and facilities to test new warfighting concepts. Congress is likely to accept much of this. House and Senate committees have recommended `authorising`, `respectively`, $37bn and $45bn more than the $802bn defence budget requested by the administration.  

1. priority n. 优先事项；最重要的事；首要事情

-  I can authorize payments up to ￡5000. 我有权批准的付款限额为5000英镑。

6. respectively adv. 分别；各自；顺序为；依次为

## Para.11

**For Bonnie Glaser of the German Marshall Fund, another think-tank, any conflict is likely to be caused by political change more than a `shifting` power balance. Even if China’s forces were unprepared, Mr Xi would not hesitate to go to war if he felt Taiwan was moving towards independence, `thereby` `humiliating` the Communist Party. `That said`, she thinks he would live for some time with the current `status quo` that keeps Taiwan in a `twilight` zone—`de facto` autonomous, but not recognised as independent by major powers—if he felt the island was not slipping away. "I don’t think that the party is going to fall if Xi Jinping doesn’t achieve reunification with Taiwan," she says.**

- [only before noun] adj.

- ( **formal** ) used to describe a state in which things are strange and mysterious, or where things are kept secret and do not seem to be part of the real world 奇妙神秘的；虚幻的

  - the **twilight world of** the occult 神秘学的虚幻世界
  - They lived in the **twilight zone** on the fringes of society. 他们生活在社会边缘的过渡区域。

- used to describe a situation or area of thought that is not clearly defined （局面或思想领域）朦胧的，模糊的，界限不清的

7. de facto （从拉丁语引用）实际上存在的（不一定合法）
8. reunification n. 重新统一

## Para.12

**The political calendar could thus produce the next crisis.

2. hint v. ~ (at sth) 暗示；透露；示意

## Para.13

In America the `bipartisan` `Taiwan Policy Act`, under debate in Congress, would include such `China-poking` measures as declaring Taiwan to be "a major `non-nato` ally" and upgrading its `envoy` to `ambassador-like status`. In midterm elections in November, Democrats may lose one or both houses of Congress to more `hawkish` Republicans; similarly, the White House could `switch` in 2024. Taiwan holds a presidential election the same year. Might a new Taiwanese president then `push for independence`, and gain `recognition` from America? Such a prospect, argues Ms Glaser, could be a real trigger for war.
